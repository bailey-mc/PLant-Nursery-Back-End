# Plant-Nursery-Back-End
FULLSTACK MERN APP
An app used to list different types of plants for sale.

## Struggles:
- I couldn't add a payment to my Heroku so Bailey had to deploy the back end server onto her Heroku.

- The Heroku app was not working properly. Bailey got a H10 error from Heroku and we couldn't resolve it until we looked up the error code and found this article: `https://dev.to/lawrence_eagles/causes-of-heroku-h10-app-crashed-error-and-how-to-solve-them-3jnl`. To fix it, we trialed and errored and tried `heroku restart` in the terminal and that fixed the problem.

## Features of the app
- All the plants are displayed upon page loading.

- Able to edit/update or delete an existing listing.

- Toggles to show all plants or add a new listing at the top of the page.
